-How to use?

-Create a Real number-
create a Real using: Real varName = newReal(numerator,denominator);
Example: Real num = newReal( 10, 3 );

-Make operations between Real numbers-
First: create the two Real numbers you want to operate with.
Second: create a third Real number to save the results.
Third: use the functions available.

Functions:
(using Real number a, Real number b, and Real number r where r is the result)

sum: r.sum( a, b, &r );
This is: a + b = r

subtraction: r.subtraction( a, b, &r );
This is: a - b = r

multiplication: r.multiplication( a, b, &r );
This is: a * b = r

division: r.division( a, b, &r );
This is: a / b = r

simplify: r.simplify( &r );
This is r being simplify

flip: r.flip( &r );
This ir a / b = b / r
